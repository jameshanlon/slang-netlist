slang-netlist is tool built on top of [slang](https://sv-lang.com) for
analysing the source-level static connectivity of a SystemVerilog design.
This can be useful to develop structural checks or investigate timing paths,
for example, rather than having to use synthesis to obtain a gate-level netlist. 
slang-netlist can be used as a C++ library, a Python module or as a command-line
tool. 

Using an example of a simple adder:

```
module adder
  #(parameter p_width = 32)(
    input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_a,
    input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_b,
    output logic [p_width-1:0] o_sum,
    output logic               o_co
  );
  logic [p_width-1:0] sum;
  logic co;
  assign {co, sum} = i_a + i_b;
  assign o_sum = sum;
  assign o_co = co;
endmodule
```

The ``slang-netlist`` command-line tool can be used to trace paths through the
design, such as:

```
âžœ  slang-netlist adder.sv --from adder.i_a --to adder.o_sum -q
adder.sv:10:22: note: variable i_a read from
  assign {co, sum} = i_a + i_b;
                     ^~~
adder.sv:10:15: note: variable sum assigned to
  assign {co, sum} = i_a + i_b;
              ^~~
adder.sv:11:18: note: variable sum read from
  assign o_sum = sum;
                 ^~~
adder.sv:11:10: note: variable o_sum assigned to
  assign o_sum = sum;
         ^~~~~
```
