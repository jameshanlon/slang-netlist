/** @mainpage Slang netlist

Slang Netlist is built on top of [slang](https://sv-lang.com) for analysing the
source-level static connectivity of a SystemVerilog design. It uses slang's AST
and data-flow analyses to construct a dependency graph of operations and provides
facilities for interacting with this data structure.

Slang Netlist is a C++ library and provides a command-line tool for interactive
use, and a Python module for straightforward integration into scripts. Possible
applications include timing path investigation, creation of tests for design
structure and connectivity, or checking of structural patterns for
quality-of-result reporting.

@section features Features

- Data dependencies that are resolved to a bit level.
- Procedural dependencies in always blocks, including evaluation of
  constant-valued conditions and unrolling of static loops.
- Integration with the facilities of slang's libraries.
- A command-line tool for interactive use.
- Python bindings to integrate the tool into scripts.
